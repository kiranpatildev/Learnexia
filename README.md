## 🧠 What is Learnexia?

Traditional classroom learning is passive:

> Teachers teach → Students listen → Students review notes

But students learn best through **repetition, interaction, and challenge** — the same way they learn games.

Learnexia takes a lecture and converts it into learning assets automatically:

- 📘 **Structured Study Notes**
- 🧠 **Flashcards for Spaced Repetition**
- 📝 **Quizzes with Adjustable Difficulty**
- 🎮 **Learning Games** (Crossword, Hot Potato, Match Pairs, Quick Drop)
- 👩‍🏫 **AI-Driven Behavior Insights**

**Students learn by playing, not just reading.**
